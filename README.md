## Overview
This project involves implementing a LinkedList from scratch in Java. The project includes the following features:
- Basic LinkedList operations (insertion, deletion, traversal)
- Algorithms for detecting a cycle in a LinkedList
- Reversing a LinkedList
- Merging two sorted LinkedLists

## Features
- **Basic LinkedList Operations**: Insert, delete, and traverse nodes in the LinkedList.
- **Cycle Detection**: Detect if a cycle exists in the LinkedList using Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm.
- **Reversing a LinkedList**: Reverse the nodes in the LinkedList.
- **Merging Two Sorted LinkedLists**: Merge two sorted LinkedLists into a single sorted LinkedList.
 
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kjmutsch/linked-list.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd LinkedListProject
    ```
3. Compile the Java files:
    ```sh
    javac LinkedList.java
    ```
 
## Usage
1. Run the main class to see the LinkedList operations in action:
    ```sh
    java LinkedList
    ```
 
## Algorithms
 
### Detecting a Cycle
The algorithm uses Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare) to detect a cycle in the LinkedList.
 
### Reversing a LinkedList
The algorithm reverses the LinkedList by changing the next pointers of the nodes.
 
### Merging Two Sorted LinkedLists
The algorithm merges two sorted LinkedLists into a single sorted LinkedList.
